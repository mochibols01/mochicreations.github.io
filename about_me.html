    </br>
   
    <p>     I'm Art John Sappa Sobrepe√±a, 21 Years old. Currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and I'm on my 4th year. I'm from my hometown Naguilian. It is a must in our course that we should be inlcined in subjects such as circuits and electronics but I learned from myself that it is my passion to become a web developer. Although its a little bit afar from our specialties that we must learn, I tried so hard and studied it myself and I find it really fun. This site is dedicated to Abbygale Saluta who has been my inspiration for me to become interested again with my academic responsibilities.</p>
